THE DARK LORD ASCENDING 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards 
apart in the narrow, moonlit lane.",['THE DARK'],['THE DARK'],[]
"For a second they 
stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s 
chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed 
their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking 
briskly in the same direction.",[],[],[]
“News?” asked the taller of the two.,[],[],[]
"“The best,” replied Severus Snape.",['Severus Snape'],['Severus Snape'],['Severus Snape']
"The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low- 
growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly 
manicured hedge.",[],[],[]
"The men’s long cloaks flapped 
around their ankles as they marched.",[],[],[]
"“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt 
features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight.",['Yaxley'],['Yaxley'],['Corban Yaxley']
"“It was a little 
trickier than I expected.",[],[],[]
"But I hope he will be 
satisfied.",[],[],[]
"You sound confident that your reception will 
be good?” 





Snape nodded, but did not elaborate.",['Snape'],['Snape'],['Severus Snape']
"They turned 
right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane.",[],[],[]
"The 
high hedge curved with them, running off into the 
distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron 
gates barring the men’s way.",[],[],[]
"Neither of them broke 
step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of 
salute and passed straight through, as though the 
dark metal were smoke.",[],[],[]
"The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s 
footsteps.",[],[],[]
"There was a rustle somewhere to their 
right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his 
companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved 
to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, 
strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.",['Yaxley'],['Yaxley'],['Corban Yaxley']
"“He always did himself well, Lucius.",['Lucius'],['Lucius'],['Lucius Malfoy']

snort.",['Yaxley'],['Yaxley'],['Corban Yaxley']

the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the 
diamond-paned downstairs windows.",[],[],[]
"Somewhere in 
the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was 
playing.",[],[],[]

inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly 
opened it.","['Gravel', 'Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Gravel', 'Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Severus Snape', 'Corban Yaxley']"

the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode 
past.","['Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Severus Snape', 'Corban Yaxley']"

leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of 
a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.",['Snape'],['Snape'],['Severus Snape']

long and ornate table.",[],[],[]

handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a 
gilded mirror.",['Illumination'],['Illumination'],[]

moment on the threshold.","['Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Snape', 'Yaxley']","['Severus Snape', 'Corban Yaxley']"
"As their eyes grew 
accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn 
upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an 
apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside 
down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in 
the bare, polished surface of the table below.",[],[],[]
"None of 
the people seated underneath this singular sight was 
looking at it except for a pale young man sitting 
almost directly below it.",[],[],[]

himself from glancing upward every minute or so.",[],[],[]
“Yaxley.,[],[],[]
"Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head 
of the table.",['Snape'],['Snape'],['Severus Snape']
"“You are very nearly late.” 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the 
fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new 
arrivals to make out more than his silhouette.",[],[],[]
"As they 
drew nearer, however, his face shone through the 
gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and 
gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical.",[],[],[]

so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.",[],[],[]

on his immediate right.","['Severus', 'Voldemort']","['Severus', 'Voldemort']","['Severus Snape', 'Lord Voldemort']"

eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to 
him that Voldemort spoke first.","['Snape', 'Voldemort']","['Snape', 'Voldemort']","['Severus Snape', 'Lord Voldemort']"
"“So?” 

“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move 
Harry Potter from his current place of safety on 
Saturday next, at nightfall.”

red eyes fastened upon Snape ’s black ones with such 
intensity that some of the watchers looked away, 
apparently fearful that they themselves would be 
scorched by the ferocity of the gaze.",['Snape'],['Snape'],['Severus Snape']
"Snape, however, 
looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a 
moment or two, Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into 
something like a smile.","['Snape', 'Voldemort']","['Snape', 'Voldemort']","['Severus Snape', 'Lord Voldemort']"
“Good.,[],[],[]

"And this information comes — ”

at Voldemort and Snape.","['Yaxley', 'Voldemort', 'Snape']","['Yaxley', 'Voldemort', 'Snape']","['Corban Yaxley', 'Lord Voldemort', 'Severus Snape']"
All faces turned to him.,[],[],[]
"“My Lord, I have heard differently.” 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he 
went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will 
not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the 
boy turns seventeen.” 

Snape was smiling.","['Yaxley', 'Voldemort', 'Dawlish', 'Auror', 'Potter', 'Snape']","['Yaxley', 'Voldemort', 'Dawlish', 'Auror', 'Potter', 'Snape']","['Corban Yaxley', 'Lord Voldemort', 'John Dawlish', 'Harry Potter', 'Severus Snape']"

has been placed upon Dawlish.","['Confundus', 'Dawlish']","['Confundus', 'Dawlish']",['John Dawlish']
"It would not be the 
first time; he is known to be susceptible.”

certain,” said Yaxley.","['Dawlish', 'Yaxley']","['Dawlish', 'Yaxley']","['John Dawlish', 'Corban Yaxley']"

Potter.","['Yaxley', 'Auror Office', 'Harry Potter']","['Yaxley', 'Auror Office', 'Harry Potter']","['Corban Yaxley', 'Harry Potter']"
"The Order believes that we have infiltrated the 
Ministry.” 

“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a 
squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he 
gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there 
along the table.","['Order', 'Order Yaxley']","['Order', 'Order Yaxley']",[]
Voldemort did not laugh.,['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"His gaze had wandered 
upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he 
seemed to be lost in thought.",[],[],[]
"“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an 
entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy

subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort 
turned back to Snape.","['Yaxley', 'Dawlish', 'Voldemort', 'Yaxley Voldemort', 'Snape']","['Yaxley', 'Dawlish', 'Voldemort', 'Yaxley Voldemort', 'Snape']","['Corban Yaxley', 'John Dawlish', 'Lord Voldemort', 'Severus Snape']"

place, according to the source, has been given every 
protection that the Order and Ministry together could 
provide.","['Order', 'Ministry']","['Order', 'Ministry']",[]
"I think that there is little chance of taking 
him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the 
Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might 
give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough 
of the enchantments to break through the rest.” 

“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the 
firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes.","['Ministry', 'Yaxley', 'Voldemort']","['Ministry', 'Yaxley', 'Voldemort']","['Corban Yaxley', 'Lord Voldemort']"

Once again, all heads turned.",['Ministry'],['Ministry'],[]

shoulders.",['Yaxley'],['Yaxley'],['Corban Yaxley']
"“My Lord, I have good news on that score.",[],[],[]
"I have — 
with difficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in 
placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked 
impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, 
twisted face, clapped him on the back.","['Imperius Curse', 'Pius', 'Yaxley', 'Dolohov']","['Imperius Curse', 'Pius', 'Yaxley', 'Dolohov']","['Pius Thicknesse', 'Corban Yaxley', 'Antonin Dolohov']"

one man.",['Thicknesse'],['Thicknesse'],['Pius Thicknesse']
"Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our 
people before I act.",['Scrimgeour'],['Scrimgeour'],['Rufus Scrimgeour']
"One failed attempt on the 
Minister’s life will set me back a long way.” 

“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as 
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the 
Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the 
other Ministry departments.","['Head', 'Department', 'Magical Law Enforcement', 'Thicknesse', 'Ministry']","['Head', 'Department', 'Magical Law Enforcement', 'Thicknesse', 'Ministry']",['Pius Thicknesse']
"It will, I think, be easy 
now that we have such a high-ranking official under 
our control, to subjugate the others, and then they 
can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.” 

“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered 
before he has converted the rest,” said Voldemort.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"“At 
any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be 
mine before next Saturday.",['Ministry'],['Ministry'],[]
"If we cannot touch the 
boy at his destination, then it must be done while he 
travels.” 

“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, 
who seemed determined to receive some portion of 
approval.",['Yaxley'],['Yaxley'],['Corban Yaxley']
"“We now have several people planted within 
the Department of Magical Transport.","['Department', 'Magical Transport']","['Department', 'Magical Transport']",[]

immediately.” 










“He will not do either,” said Snape.","['Potter Apparates', 'Floo Network', 'Snape']","['Potter Apparates', 'Floo Network', 'Snape']",['Severus Snape']
"“The Order is 
eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or 
regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to 
do with the place.” 

“All the better,” said Voldemort.","['Order', 'Ministry', 'Voldemort']","['Order', 'Ministry', 'Voldemort']",['Lord Voldemort']
"“He will have to move 
in the open.",[],[],[]

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving 
body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in 
person.","['Again', 'Voldemort']","['Again', 'Voldemort']",['Lord Voldemort']
"There have been too many mistakes where 
Harry Potter is concerned.",['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter']
"Some of them have been 
my own.",[],[],[]
"That Potter lives is due more to my errors 
than to his triumphs.” 

The company around the table watched Voldemort 
apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for 
Harry Potter’s continued existence.","['Voldemort', 'Harry Potter']","['Voldemort', 'Harry Potter']","['Lord Voldemort', 'Harry Potter']"
"Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than 
to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body 
above him.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by 
luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best- 
laid plans.",[],[],[]
But I know better now.,[],[],[]
"I understand those 
things that I did not understand before.",[],[],[]
"I must be the 
one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.” 

At these words, seemingly in response to them, a 
sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of 
misery and pain.",['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter']
"Many of those at the table looked 
downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to 
issue from below their feet.",[],[],[]
"“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his 
quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes 
from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to 
you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” 





“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down 
the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair 
that it had appeared, at first glance, to be 
unoccupied.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him 
but a curious gleam of silver.",[],[],[]
"“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again 
at the tense faces of his followers, “I understand 
better now.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"I shall need, for instance, to borrow a 
wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.” 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; 
he might have announced that he wanted to borrow 
one of their arms.",[],[],[]
“No volunteers?” said Voldemort.,['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"“Let’s see ... Lucius, 
I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.” 

Lucius Malfoy looked up.","['Lucius', 'Lucius Malfoy']","['Lucius', 'Lucius Malfoy']","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Lucius Malfoy']"
"His skin appeared yellowish 
and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken 
and shadowed.",[],[],[]

“Your wand, Lucius.",['Lucius'],['Lucius'],['Lucius Malfoy']

Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife.",['Malfoy'],['Malfoy'],['Lucius Malfoy']
"She was staring 
straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long 
blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the 
table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist.",[],[],[]
"At 
her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, 
withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, 
who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it 
closely.","['Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Lord Voldemort']"
"“What is it?” 





“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.",['Malfoy'],['Malfoy'],['Lucius Malfoy']
"“And the core?” 

“Dragon — dragon heartstring.” 

“Good,” said Voldemort.","['Dragon', 'Voldemort']","['Dragon', 'Voldemort']",['Lord Voldemort']
"He drew out his own wand 
and compared the lengths.",[],[],[]
"Lucius Malfoy made an 
involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it 
seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s wand in 
exchange for his own.","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Lord Voldemort']"
"The gesture was not missed by 
Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']

"My wand?” 

Some of the throng sniggered.",[],[],[]
"“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not 
enough for you?",['Lucius'],['Lucius'],['Lucius Malfoy']
"But I have noticed that you and your 
family seem less than happy of late.",[],[],[]
"... What is it 
about my presence in your home that displeases you, 
Lucius?” 

“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!” 

“Such lies, Lucius ...” 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel 
mouth had stopped moving.",['Lucius'],['Lucius'],['Lucius Malfoy']
"One or two of the wizards 
barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew 
louder; something heavy could be heard sliding 
across the floor beneath the table.",[],[],[]
"The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up 
Voldemort’s chair.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']
"It rose, seemingly endlessly, and 
came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck 
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their 
vertical slits for pupils, unblinking.",['Voldemort'],['Voldemort'],['Lord Voldemort']

the creature absently with long thin fingers, still 
looking at Lucius Malfoy.","['Voldemort', 'Lucius Malfoy']","['Voldemort', 'Lucius Malfoy']","['Lord Voldemort', 'Lucius Malfoy']"

"His hand 
shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip.",[],[],[]

desire it — we do.”

eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake.","['Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Malfoy', 'Voldemort']","['Lucius Malfoy', 'Lord Voldemort']"

right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the 
inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort

"“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the 
table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an 
honor to have you here, in our family’s house.",[],[],[]
"There 
can be no higher pleasure.” 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with 
her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in 
bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and 
impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for 
mere words could not demonstrate her longing for 
closeness.","['Narcissa', 'Bellatrix', 'Voldemort']","['Narcissa', 'Bellatrix', 'Voldemort']","['Narcissa Malfoy', 'Bellatrix Lestrange', 'Lord Voldemort']"

of delight.",['Bellatrix'],['Bellatrix'],['Bellatrix Lestrange']

event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this 
week?”

around the table.",[],[],[]

gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists.",[],[],[]

mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters

catcalls and jeers.","['Draco', 'Voldemort']","['Draco', 'Voldemort']","['Draco Malfoy', 'Lord Voldemort']"
