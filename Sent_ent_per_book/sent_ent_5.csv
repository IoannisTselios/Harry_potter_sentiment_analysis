DUDLEY DEMENTED 

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to

drought.",[],[],[]

lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive

nonexistent breeze.",['Privet Drive'],['Privet Drive'],[]

a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a 
flower bed outside number four.",[],[],[]

who has grown a lot in a short space of time.",[],[],[]

jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and 
faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away 
from the uppers.",[],[],[]
"Harry Potter’s appearance did not 
endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of 
people who thought scruffiness ought to be 



punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself 
behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was 
quite invisible to passersby.",['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter'],['Harry Potter']

would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt 
Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room

congratulated on his idea of hiding here.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard 
earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not 
hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as 
had happened every time he had tried sitting down in 
the living room and watching television with his aunt 
and uncle.",[],[],[]

the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle,

every night of the summer holidays.","['Dursleys', 'Dudley']","['Dursleys', 'Dudley']",['Dudley Dursley']

perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea

relief, and then mounting tension again .",[],[],[]

always, growing more insistent all the time, the 
question of why nothing had happened yet...",[],[],[]
"He kept listening, just in case there was some small 
clue, not recognized for what it really was by the 
Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, 
perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the 
drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next 
door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on 
at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had 
almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous 
actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if 
we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt 
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in 
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).","['Muggles', 'Southeast', 'Uncle Vernon', 'Surrey', 'Aunt Petunia']","['Muggles', 'Southeast', 'Vernon', 'Surrey', 'Petunia']","['Vernon Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley']"

Barnsley, has learned to water-ski!","['Bungy', 'Barnsley']","['Bungy', 'Barnsley']",[]

worth hearing.",[],[],[]
"He rolled cautiously onto his front and 





raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing 
to crawl out from under the window.",[],[],[]
"He had moved about two inches when several things 
happened in very quick succession.",[],[],[]
"A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a 
gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car 
and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and 
the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ 
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting 
for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time 
pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden 
wand as if he were unsheathing a sword.","['Dursleys', 'Harry']","['Dursleys', 'Harry']",['Harry Potter']
"But before 
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his 
head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and 
the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even 
louder.","['Dursleys', 'Aunt Petunia']","['Dursleys', 'Petunia']",['Petunia Dursley']
"Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes 
streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street

staggered upright again when two large purple hands 
reached through the open window and closed tightly 
around his throat.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

ear.","['Vernon', 'Harry']","['Vernon', 'Harry']","['Vernon Dursley', 'Harry Potter']"

they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- 
like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a 
firm grip on his raised wand.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']
"Then, as the pain in the 
top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, 
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he 
had received an electric shock — some invisible force 
seemed to have surged through his nephew, making 
him impossible to hold.","['Harry', 'Uncle Vernon']","['Harry', 'Vernon']","['Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley']"
"Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, 
straightened up, and stared around.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but 
there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows.",[],[],[]

into his jeans and tried to look innocent.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

Mrs.",['Uncle Vernon'],['Vernon'],['Vernon Dursley']

net curtains.",[],[],[]
"“Did you hear that car backfire just 
now?",[],[],[]
"Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 

He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all 
the curious neighbors had disappeared from their 
various windows, then the grin became a grimace of 
rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.","['Gave Petunia', 'Harry']","['Gave Petunia', 'Harry']",['Harry Potter']

just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon’s 
outstretched hands could resume their strangling.","['Harry', 'Uncle Vernon']","['Harry', 'Vernon']","['Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley']"
"“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle 
Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury.",['Uncle Vernon'],['Vernon'],['Vernon Dursley']
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly.,['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']
"He kept 
looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see 
the person who had made the cracking noise.",[],[],[]

our — ”

Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one.","['Aunt Petunia', 'Uncle Vernon']","['Petunia', 'Vernon']","['Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley']"

under our window, boy?”

voice.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any 
more of this listening to the news tosh!",[],[],[]
"You know 
perfectly well that your lot ...” 

“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle 
Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely 
hear him, ""... that your lot don’t get on our news!”

"What are 
all those — ” she too lowered her voice so that Harry 
had to lip-read the next word, “ — owls — doing if 
they’re not bringing you news?” 

“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper.","['Harry', 'Uncle Vernon']","['Harry', 'Vernon']","['Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley']"

all your news from those pestilential birds!” 

Harry hesitated for a moment.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at 
admitting it.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

"“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper 
rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, 
he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, 
stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off 
up the street.","['Harry', 'Dursleys']","['Harry', 'Dursleys']",['Harry Potter']
He was in trouble now and he knew it.,[],[],[]

to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for 
his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at 
the moment; he had much more pressing matters on 
his mind.",[],[],[]

made by someone Apparating or Disapparating.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

not know how to become invisible...","['Privet Drive', 'Harry', 'Dobby']","['Privet Drive', 'Harry', 'Dobby']","['Harry Potter', 'Dobby']"

his shoulder.",[],[],[]

he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was 
sure of it.","['Someone', 'Aunt Petunias']","['Someone', 'Petunias']",[]

they made contact, why were they hiding now?",[],[],[]
"And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his 
certainty leaked away.",[],[],[]
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all.,[],[],[]
"Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of 
contact from the world to which he belonged that he 
was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.",[],[],[]

something breaking inside a neighbor’s house?",[],[],[]

that had plagued him all summer rolled over him 
once again...",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']

delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point 
in continuing to take it?","['Tomorrow', 'Daily Prophet']","['Tomorrow', 'Daily Prophet']",[]

front page before throwing it aside these days; when

Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive.","['Burrow', 'Privet']","['Burrow', 'Privet']",[]

dinner that night.","['Honeydukes', 'Aunt Petunia']","['Honeydukes', 'Petunia']",['Petunia Dursley']

murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly 
killed ... ?","['Hadn', 'Cedric']","['Hadn', 'Cedric']",['Cedric Diggory']

the hundredth time that summer.","['Don', 'Harry']","['Don', 'Harry']",['Harry Potter']

that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his 
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking 
moments too.",[],[],[]

along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of 
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his 
godfather.",['Magnolia Crescent'],['Magnolia Crescent'],[]

Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as 
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at 







least they contained words of caution and consolation 
instead of tantalizing hints: 

“ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your 
nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful 
and don’t do anything rash...” 

Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia 
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed 
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) 
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the

off for the Burrow by himself.","['Sirius', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Harry Magnolia Crescent', 'Magnolia Road', 'Sirius Burrow']","['Sirius', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Harry Magnolia Crescent', 'Magnolia Road', 'Sirius Burrow']","['Sirius Black', 'Harry Potter', 'Ron Weasley', 'Hermione Granger']"

"“Everard, you will need to raise the 
alarm, make sure he is found by the right people — ”

dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.","['Everard', 'Hogwarts']","['Everard', 'Hogwarts']",['Everard']

furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs

right, but Dumbledore did not look up.","['Harry', 'Dumbledore']","['Harry', 'Dumbledore']","['Harry Potter', 'Albus Dumbledore']"

question.",['Harry'],['Harry'],['Harry Potter']
"The smoke serpent, however, split itself 
instantly into two snakes, both coiling and 
undulating in the dark air.",[],[],[]

satisfaction Dumbledore gave the instrument another 
gentle tap with his wand: The clinking noise slowed

a formless haze, and vanished.",['Dumbledore'],['Dumbledore'],['Albus Dumbledore']

more accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks 
gleaming from every surface, large and small,

filled the place like thousands of minuscule,
