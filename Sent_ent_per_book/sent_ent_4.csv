THE RIDDLE HOUSE 

The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the 
Riddle House,” even though it had been many years 
since the Riddle family had lived there.","['THE RIDDLE', 'Little', 'Riddle House', 'Riddle']","['THE RIDDLE', 'Little', 'Riddle House', 'Riddle']",['Merope Riddle']
"It stood on a 
hill overlooking the village, some of its windows 
boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading 
unchecked over its face.",[],[],[]
"Once a fine-looking manor, 
and easily the largest and grandest building for miles 
around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, 
and unoccupied.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house 
was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange 
and horrible had happened there, something that the 
older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss 
when topics for gossip were scarce.",['Little Hangletons'],['Little Hangletons'],[]
"The story had 
been picked over so many times, and had been 
embroidered in so many places, that nobody was 
quite sure what the truth was anymore.",[],[],[]
"Every version 
of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty 
years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s 
morning, when the Riddle House had still been well 









kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing 
room to find all three Riddles dead.","['Riddle House', 'Riddles']","['Riddle House', 'Riddles']",[]
"The maid had run screaming down the hill into the 
village and roused as many people as she could.",[],[],[]
“Lying there with their eyes wide open!,[],[],[]
Cold as ice!,['Cold'],['Cold'],[]
"Still in their dinner things!” 

The police were summoned, and the whole of Little 
Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill- 
disguised excitement.",['Little Hangleton'],['Little Hangleton'],[]

pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they 
had been most unpopular.","['Nobody', 'Riddles']","['Nobody', 'Riddles']",[]

Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their 
grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.","['Riddle', 'Tom']","['Riddle', 'Tom']","['Merope Riddle', 'Tom']"
"All 
the villagers cared about was the identity of their 
murderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy 
people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the 
same night.",[],[],[]

that night; the whole village seemed to have turned 
out to discuss the murders.",['Hanged'],['Hanged'],[]

leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived

in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle 
House.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]

very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud 
noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever 
since.","['Frank', 'Riddles']","['Frank', 'Riddles']",['Frank Bryce']

more details.",[],[],[]

war, Frank.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']

right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.",[],[],[]

remember, when he was a kid ...” 

By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little 
Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the 
Riddles.","['Little Hangleton', 'Frank Bryce', 'Riddles']","['Little Hangleton', 'Frank Bryce', 'Riddles']",['Frank Bryce']
"But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, 
in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was 
stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was 
innocent, and that the only person he had seen near 
the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been 
a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.","['Great Hangleton', 'Frank', 'Riddles']","['Great Hangleton', 'Frank', 'Riddles']",['Frank Bryce']
"Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and 
the police were quite sure that Frank had invented 
him.","['Nobody', 'Frank']","['Nobody', 'Frank']",['Frank Bryce']
"Then, just when things were looking very serious for 
Frank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back 
and changed everything.","['Frank', 'Riddles']","['Frank', 'Riddles']",['Frank Bryce']
The police had never read an odder report.,[],[],[]
"A team of 
doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded 
that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, 
shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could 
tell) harmed at all.",['Riddles'],['Riddles'],[]
"In fact (the report continued, in a 
tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all 
appeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact 
that they were all dead.",['Riddles'],['Riddles'],[]
"The doctors did note (as 
though determined to find something wrong with the 
bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror 
upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police 
said, whoever heard of three people being frightened 
to death?",['Riddles'],['Riddles'],[]
"As there was no proof that the Riddles had been 
murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.","['Riddles', 'Frank']","['Riddles', 'Frank']",['Frank Bryce']
"The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton 
churchyard, and their graves remained objects of 
curiosity for a while.","['Riddles', 'Little Hangleton']","['Riddles', 'Little Hangleton']",[]
"To everyone’s surprise, and amid 
a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his 
cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.","['Frank Bryce', 'Riddle House']","['Frank Bryce', 'Riddle House']",['Frank Bryce']
"“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t 
care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged 










Man.","['Dot', 'Hanged']","['Dot', 'Hanged']",['Dot']
"“And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, 
knowing as how we knows he did it.” 

But Frank did not leave.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"He stayed to tend the garden 
for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and 
then the next — for neither family stayed long.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new 
owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, 
which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall 
into disrepair.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these 
days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they 
said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,” 
though nobody was very clear what these might be.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the 
gardening, however.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Frank was nearing his seventy- 
seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer 
than ever, but could be seen pottering around the 
flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds 
were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to 
suppress them.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend 
with either.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Boys from the village made a habit of 
throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle 
House.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank 
worked so hard to keep smooth.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Once or twice, they 
broke into the old house for a dare.",[],[],[]
"They knew that 
old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds 
amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused 
them to see him limping across the garden, 
brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him 
because they, like their parents and grandparents, 
thought him a murderer.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"So when Frank awoke one 
night in August and saw something very odd up at 
the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had 
gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.","['Frank', 'August']","['Frank', 'August']",['Frank Bryce']
"It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining 
him worse than ever in his old age.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"He got up and 
limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of 
refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in 
his knee.",[],[],[]
"Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he 
looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights 
glimmering in its upper windows.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"Frank knew at once 
what was going on.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"The boys had broken into the 
house again, and judging by the flickering quality of 
the light, they had started a fire.",[],[],[]
"Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had 
deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had 
taken him in for questioning about the Riddles’ 
deaths.","['Frank', 'Riddles']","['Frank', 'Riddles']",['Frank Bryce']
"He put down the kettle at once, hurried back 
upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was 
soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing 
a rusty old key from its hook by the door.",[],[],[]
"He picked 
up his walking stick, which was propped against the 
wall, and set off into the night.",[],[],[]
"The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of 
being forced, nor did any of the windows.",['Riddle House'],['Riddle House'],[]
"Frank 
limped around to the back of the house until he 
reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took 
out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the 
door noiselessly.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.,[],[],[]
"Frank had 
not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although 
it was very dark, he remembered where the door into 
the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his 
nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any 
sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"He 
reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to 
the large mullioned windows on either side of the 
front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing 
the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it 
muffled the sound of his feet and stick.",[],[],[]
"On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once 
where the intruders were: At the very end of the 
passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone 
through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across 
the black floor.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Frank edged closer and closer, 
grasping his walking stick firmly.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"Several feet from 
the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the 
room beyond.",[],[],[]
"The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate.",[],[],[]
"This 
surprised him.",[],[],[]
"Then he stopped moving and listened 
intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it 
sounded timid and fearful.",[],[],[]
"“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you 
are still hungry.” 

“Later,” said a second voice.",['My Lord'],['My Lord'],[]
"This too belonged to a 
man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as 
a sudden blast of icy wind.",[],[],[]
"Something about that 
voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s 
neck stand up.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"“Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.” 

Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better 
to hear.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"There came the clink of a bottle being put 
down upon some hard surface, and then the dull 
scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across 
the floor.",[],[],[]
"Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his 
back to the door, pushing the chair into place.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"He was 
wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald 
patch at the back of his head.",[],[],[]
"Then he went out of 
sight again.",[],[],[]
“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.,['Nagini'],['Nagini'],['Nagini']
"“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice 
nervously.",['My Lord'],['My Lord'],[]
"“She set out to explore the house, I think.",[],[],[]
"“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said 
the second voice.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]
“I will need feeding in the night.,[],[],[]
"The 
journey has tired me greatly.” 

Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer 
to the door, listening very hard.","['Brow', 'Frank']","['Brow', 'Frank']",['Frank Bryce']
"There was a pause, 
and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]
"“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay 
here?” 

“A week,” said the cold voice.",[],[],[]
“Perhaps longer.,[],[],[]
"The 
place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot 
proceed yet.",[],[],[]
"It would be foolish to act before the 
Quidditch World Cup is over.” 

Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and 
rotated it.","['Quidditch', 'Frank']","['Quidditch', 'Frank']",['Frank Bryce']
"Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, 
he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a 
word at all.",['Owing'],['Owing'],[]
"“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said 
Wormtail.","['Quidditch', 'My Lord', 'Wormtail']","['Quidditch', 'My Lord', 'Wormtail']",[]
"(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously 
into his ear.)",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"“Forgive me, but — I do not understand 
— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?” 

“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are 
pouring into the country from all over the world, and 
every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on 
duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, 
checking and double-checking identities.","['Ministry', 'Magic']","['Ministry', 'Magic']",[]
"They will be 
obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice 
anything.",['Muggles'],['Muggles'],[]
"So we wait.” 

Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"He had 
distinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,” 
“wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these 
expressions meant something secret, and Frank could 
think of only two sorts of people who would speak in 




code: spies and criminals.","['Magic', 'Frank']","['Magic', 'Frank']",['Frank Bryce']
"Frank tightened his hold 
on his walking stick once more, and listened more 
closely still.",['Frank'],['Frank'],['Frank Bryce']
"“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail 
said quietly.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]
"“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a 
note of menace in the cold voice now.",[],[],[]
"A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, 
the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he 
was forcing himself to say this before he lost his 
nerve.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]
"“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.” 

Another pause, more protracted, and then — 

“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice 
softly.","['Harry Potter', 'My']","['Harry Potter', 'My']",['Harry Potter']

“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” 
said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]
"“The boy is 
nothing to me, nothing at all!",[],[],[]

were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — 
the thing could be done so much more quickly!",[],[],[]
"If you 
allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know 
that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could 
be back here in as little as two days with a suitable 
person — ”

softly, “that is true.",[],[],[]

thoroughly relieved now.",['Wormtail'],['Wormtail'],[]

silent at once.",['Silencel'],['Silencel'],[]

excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia 
always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy

Vernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty 
little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated 
over the accusations of bullying in the report — “He’s

away.","['Uncle Vernon', 'Aunt Petunia']","['Vernon', 'Petunia']","['Vernon Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley']"

enough for him anymore.","['Aunt Petunia', 'Dudley']","['Petunia', 'Dudley']","['Petunia Dursley', 'Dudley Dursley']"
